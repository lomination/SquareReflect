## Project description

SquareReflect is a 2D maze game with open mechanics thanks to infinite possibilities of tiles.

This game allows you to play a small character lost in a level and your goal is to reach the end of the level. No gravity physics make you continue your way until you hit a tile that can allow you to choose a new direction to go.

The project is currently split in several projects :
- Core/Core.csproj manages the mechanics and global classes such as tiles, boards and games and cannot be started,
- ConsoleUI/ConsoleUI.csproj allows the Core project to be viewed and inputs to be managed via the console,
- GraphicUI/GraphicUI.csproj launches an application that makes the game clearer thanks to the MonoGame graphic labrary based on Microsoft's XNA library (currently WIP),
- Test/Test.csproj contains all the written tests.

Only a few boards are available in the 'Boards' directory, but more will be added soon. The goal is to create an editor that will allow everyone to create their own levels.

## Technologies required

This project requires .NET version 6.0. It uses the Monogame library version 3.8.1.303 and the Newtonsoft library version 13.0.3.

## Launch

### Launch via sources

#### ConsoleUI

To run the ConsoleUI project, execute the following command

```dotnet run --project ConsoleUI/ConsoleUI.csproj```

You can add the name of the board you want to play with using the seconde command. The board must be in the `SquareReflect/Boards` directory with a `.json` extension. You don't need to include the extension in the command.

```dotnet run --project ConsoleUI/ConsoleUI.csproj -- <BoardName>```

Fonts have different renderings, to maximase the visibility you can set your terminal font to `Noto Sans CJK HK Bold`.

#### GraphicUI

To run the GraphicUI project, run:

```dotnet run --project GraphicUI/GraphicUI.csproj -- <BoardName>```

The selected board must meet the same conditions as above.

#### Running tests

You can run tests with:

```dotnet test```
